    <h3>Capabilites</h3>
    <p>
        My nemesis can create, shape and manipulate visible light, commonly referred to as light, 
        is electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye, and is responsible for the sense of sight.
        <br>
        Primary properties of visible light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, 
        and polarization, while its speed in a vacuum (299,792,458 meters per second/186,000 MPS) is one of the fundamental constants of nature. 
        Visible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is experimentally found to always move at this speed in a vacuum.
        <br>
        In common with all types of EMR, visible light is emitted and absorbed in tiny "packets" called photons and exhibits properties of both waves and particles. 
        This property is referred to as the waveâ€“particle duality. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.
